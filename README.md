# SWitCH_files
Java files from SWitCH

This is my SWitCH workspace within Eclipse. 

It contains 3 main folders (disciplines), SCOMRED (Sistemas de computação e redes), DEVSOFT1 (Desenvolvimento de Software 1) and LABPROJ1 (Laboratório-Projeto 1). Each one is a project in Eclipse. Inside each project are 2 folders, src and tests. src contains the source files and tests has the JUnit test files. Each folder is organized by packages, using the the number of lectures so far and the date.
